# Fake News Classification Using Natural Language Processing
This project aims at building a model which classifies whether the news given is genuine news or false news by using Natural Language Processing 

## Datasets Used:-
1)True.csv 2)Fake.csv

All classifications comes under supervised learning and this project will also be supervised learning, the goal of supervised learning is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data

## Library Used In This Project:-
Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) : An essential library supports tasks such as classification, stemming, tagging, parsing, semantic reasoning, and tokenization in Python

## Process:-

Text Preprocessing:-
1)Tokenization
2)Stemming
3)Stopword Removal

Vectorization & Calculating TD-IDF:-
Vectorization is a technique used to convert textual data to numerical format. TD-IDF basically tells importance of the word in the corpus or dataset

Applying Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier

## Result:-
The accuracy of prediction achieved is 99.58129175946547
